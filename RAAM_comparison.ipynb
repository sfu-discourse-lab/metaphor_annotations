The Bread and Circuses of the Internet keep us entertained while wealth and power becomes concentrated into the hands of a very select few.Aldous Huxley, Douglas Adams, and Neil Postman had it right. We are amusing ourselves to death. And I'm reminded of that scene in Ninotchka where Melvyn Douglas turns on the radio while romancing Greta Garbo and says his radio is 'a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in, they tell you there's a new model out.'Who's watching the smart watchmen?\n",
      "Innovation is the critical component to improving our lives, whether for basic information technology or health and well being. Canada is almost trailing the industrial world in the use of electronic health records and our joy of waging war on drug companies keeps us in the last quartile of pharmaceutical innovation because we can't afford the cost of risk, research and development. It appears we enjoy adopting some technology at a fast pace but we assume the barrier to other technologies, primarily controlled by government, are not as important.\n",

      "No, no line in the sand; but one person's 'necessary' is another person's 'don't need it'. I don't necessarily want to 'make do with less'; but I have what I need to do what I want. I have a camera (digital) to take pictures with; a watch to tell me what time it is; a Blackberry that lets me send and receive texts and phone calls. If I want to check e-mail, Facebook, browse the web, Google something, I have a computer. When I'm away from it, I'm at work, or doing something where a computer isn't necessary (like cooking, gardening, reading, watching a DVD). If I have a burning need to find something out Right This Very Second - well, it can usually wait until I'm near a computer. And I'm fine with all that, just as I'm fine with people who absolutely, positively can't live without something that does everything except open the garage door (and I'm sure there's an app for that). So don't judge people who don't have to have the latest i Whatever as hopeless fuddy-duddy stick-in-the-muds who'd go back to wind-up gramophone s if they had a chance (that said, I do have a wind-up gramophone, which my son - born in 1997, and as wired as they come - thinks is wonderful). I edit a weekly newspaper, and use Photoshop and InDesign to put the whole thing together; a long way from the physical lay-out and paste-up I learned with, and I wouldn't go back to those days for all the hot wax in the world.\n",

      "Thanks for your reply. Perhaps 'line in the sand' was the wrong simile (or expression). I'm just pointing out that everyone gets to a point at which they're comfortable with the way they do things. There's no reason to embrace new technology if what you have and are used to does what you want it to. But there's also nothing wrong with wanting to do things 'the new way' because we all did things in new ways at some point in our lives.I'm not much younger than you I suspect since my eldest is only a few years younger than yours but I think I might still be more open to 'the latest thing'. \n",
      "That's actually a really good point! When people spend north of $10K on a watch, they expect it to last the rest of their lives or at least a good long time. Apple is going to have to ensure the Watch is compatible with future i Phones too. If they end up obsolescing the $13K watch in two years they will generate quite the backlash.\n",

      "While technology does march on, sometimes it takes a few backwards steps towards true progress. Case in point are the ipads and tablets which I see as little more than toys for the easily distracted. While tablets are today's rage that have led to the nosediving of the laptop, anyone who has used these new devices knows all to well their limitations. Trying to compose an email on a ipad is like communicating in morse code or sending a telegram circa 1913. The same goes for the smartwatch which does not even have GPS, which every cheap digital camera has, big mistake. But what do I know, I'm a geezer and still tell the time by a watch with a face. \n",
